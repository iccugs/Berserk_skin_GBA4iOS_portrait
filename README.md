Berserk Skins for GBA4iOS - portrait and landscape
_______________________________

This should all be really straightforward to get up and running.

If you want to mess with the image, edit the picture file with GIMP or Photoshop or something.

If you want to mess with the button layout, edit the json file with an appropriate text editor.

The zip.sh shellscript is just something I was using to remove the .gbaskin file and then repack the modified files into a new .gbaskin file.

If you have no intention of editing anything, just download the berserk.gbaskin file with Safari on your iPhone that has GBA4iOS on it, and share the file with the GBA4iOS app using the button on the top right of Safari. If you need a better explaination than that, there are a plethora of YouTube videos on the internet that lay it all out there and walk you through the process step by step.

Have fun playing your legally purchased and backed up Game Boy Advance games on your iPhone!
